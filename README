dlvhex - mcsequilibrium plugin (0.0.1)
    
    enables dlvhex to use scripts for generating atoms and
    to rewrite whole input programs using a script before processing them
    
* Requirements:
    
    - dlvhex (version >= 1.4)
    - (optional) dlvhex-stringplugin (just needed for the tests and examples)
    
* Installation:
    
    - ./configure
      (use switch --enable-userinstall to install plugin into home directory)
    - make install
    
* Testing:
    
    - make check
    - you can also run 'make all' in dlvhex-scriptplugin-0.1.0/examples/demos/
    
* Usage:
    
    - script-atom:
        
        The plugin provides a single atom:
            
            &script[COMMAND_STRING](OUTPUT)
            
        COMMAND_STRING is the command to be executed
        OUTPUT is line-wise
        
        The output of the atom is the set of lines that is returned from the
        call of the command-string. The resulting atoms are all single-tuples.
        The data-type of a tuple (number:without quotes; string:with quotes)
        depends on the resulting line (contains only digits?).
        
    - script-converter:
        
        In order to specify a script for converting the input, the following
        command-line flag hast to be passed to dlvhex. 
            
            --convert=SCRIPT
            
        SCRIPT is the script that converts the input file before passing it
               back to dlvhex.
               
        The plugin calls your script with a file, containing the input, as the
        first argument. This means that you have to read the content of the
        file that you get as the first argument. After processing the
        file-content you can pass the modified dlvhex-input back to dlvhex by
        printing it out to STDOUT.
        
        
    Notes: - you can use *.sh, *.awk, *.py, *.pl,... as scripts
           - Every script you want to use within the script-atom or the
             script-converter has to be exutable (permissions!).
             (You can set the permission by using: chmod +x script.file)
             
           - To use a script directly, without having to specify its path,
             you have to add its directory to the $PATH variable.
             (you can set the path-variable with: PATH=$PATH:/dir/to/script/)
             
           - Use so-called shebangs to specify in the script with which
             interpreter it is meant to be called.
             http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)
             
           - The output of a script, terminating with an error, will be
             ignored.
