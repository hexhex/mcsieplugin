% ctx1 is a database about tweedy: either the context believes that tweedy is a
% penguin, or it believes that tweedy is a dove
#context(1,"dlv_asp_context_acc", "./test1/dlvctx_ctx1.dlv").

% ctx2 is a reasoning about birds, it says that they can fly unless they are
% penguins
r1: (2:bird) :- (1:tweedy_is_penguin).
r2: (2:bird) :- (1:tweedy_is_dove).
r3: (2:penguin) :- (1:tweedy_is_penguin).
#context(2,"dlv_asp_context_acc", "./test1/dlvctx_ctx2.dlv").

% ctx3 gives an advice to someone finding a bird on the floor, namely either to
% rescue it or to do nothing, the context enforces rescuing for flying birds
%
% a guess is made in the bridge rules, the context "kills" the wrong guess,
% using information from the bird classification context
r4: (3:rescue) :- not (3:do_nothing).
r5: (3:do_nothing) :- not (3:rescue).
r6: (3:needs_rescue) :- (2:can_fly).

% there should exist exactly the following three output-projected equilibria:

% tweedy is a penguin, cannot fly and we should do nothing
% ({tweedy_is_penguin},{},{do_nothing})
%
% tweedy is a penguin, cannot fly and we should "rescue it"
% ({tweedy_is_penguin},{},{rescue})
%
% tweedy is a dove, cannot fly and we should rescue it
% ({tweedy_is_dove},{can_fly},{rescue})
